# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Project
This is a purely exploratory project, identifying patterns in customer data of an auto insurance company before moving on to predicting factors affecting Customer Lifetime Value. I used Python for this exploration.

The data was part of a project I had completed for my analytics certification from Ivy Professional School. It consists of 9134 records and 24 variables. 

The process of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is crucial before embarking on any modeling procedure. I hope this notebook gives you an idea of the structure I follow in my analysis work.
